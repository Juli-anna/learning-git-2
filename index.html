            <h2>Hey!</h2>
            <h6>by Herman de Coninck XD</h6>
            <p>We walk, the two of us, through the autumn day.<br>And in spring too I feel no different.<br>We walk through much brown tavern-brown of leaves<br>through much dark-red loss, appellation control√©e,<br><br>that deepens in the cellar of the years.<br>We walk through the beiger-turning woods of Drente.<br>Hear the wind passing through the hennaed trees<br>sounding like an oboe, tramp among instruments.<br><br>33, and in the midst of the dark wood<br>of life. And with a sense of nowhere belonging,<br>at home in the woods and desolate at home.<br><br>Will we one day, maybe, ever?<br>The summer is past, the hay-making is over.<br>The here is nowhere, and the now is never.</p>
